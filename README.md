# Senior-Design-Autonomous-Target-Scoring-Drone
The purpose of the Autonomous Target-Scoring Drone (ATSD) is to automate accuracy verification and bomb damage assessment at U.S. Naval bomb ranges. Such a system is needed because artillery targets are commonly placed a long distance away from artillery trainees.  The graphical user interface is used to control and see the status of the drone at all times. There is a text editor created to have users be able to type down any comments or notes needed.

The graphical user interface (GUI) allows the user to control and maintain the staus of the drone at all times. It incoporates computer vision and its own OS to save and open files on the text editor.
